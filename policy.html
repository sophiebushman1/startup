            <h4>Quick Tips for Keeping Your Jewelry in Top Shape:</h4>
            <p>Saltwater & Chlorine: A quick rinse with fresh water after swimming helps prevent any damage.</p>
            <p>Chemicals: Avoid lotions, sunscreen, and perfumes â€“ they can dull the shine.</p>
            <p>Storage: When you're not wearing it, keep your jewelry dry and in a safe spot.</p>

            <p>While our jewelry is water-resistant, remember that constant exposure to water (especially saltwater) can affect its appearance over time.</p>
            <p>Enjoy your pieces, but treat them with care to keep them shining bright!</p>
