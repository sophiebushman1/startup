          At Cocojewel, we create jewelry designed to keep up with your beach days and poolside fun.
          Our water-resistant pieces can handle splashes, but a little care goes a long way in keeping them looking great.

        <h4>Quick Tips for Keeping Your Jewelry in Top Shape:</h4>
        <p>Saltwater & Chlorine: A quick rinse with fresh water after swimming helps prevent any damage.</p>
        <p>Chemicals: Avoid lotions, sunscreen, and perfumes â€“ they can dull the shine.</p>
        <p>Storage: When you're not wearing it, keep your jewelry dry and in a safe spot.</p>

          While our jewelry is water-resistant, remember that constant exposure to water (especially saltwater) can affect its appearance over time.

        <p>Enjoy your pieces, but treat them with care to keep them shining bright!</p>
