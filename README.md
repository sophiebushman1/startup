# CSS Styling and Improvements

# 1. Global Styling
# - **Font Family**: The entire website uses the `Courier New` font or a similar monospaced font (`Courier, monospace`) to give a consistent and clean look across all pages.
# - **Body Background**: Applied a light teal background color (`#b2f2e9`) to give the site a refreshing and modern appearance.

# 2. Header Design
# - **Pastel Pink Header**: The header across all pages features a pastel bright pink background (`#ffccdd`) with a slightly darker border to enhance the visual appeal.
# - **Centered Text**: The header content is centered for a professional and clean layout.

# 3. Link Styling
# - **Custom Link Color**: Links are styled with a dark gray color (`#333`) to avoid the default blue color.
# - **Hover Effect**: When users hover over links, they become bold, providing a visual cue for interactivity.

# 4. Interactive Elements with Transition
# - **Smooth Hover Transitions**: Interactive elements such as buttons, product items, and cart items have a smooth transition effect when hovered over.
#   - **Buttons**: Change background color on hover for a more interactive feel.
#   - **Product and Cart Items**: Slight zoom-in effect (`transform: scale(1.05)`) when hovering over product or cart items, giving a polished user experience.

# 5. Responsive Design
# - The website layout adjusts based on screen size:
#   - For smaller screens, product items resize to 45% width or 100% width, ensuring a mobile-friendly design.
#   - Buttons expand to fit the screen width on smaller devices.

---

# How to Use the CSS
# - The `style.css` file is linked in all HTML files to provide consistent styling across the entire website.
# - Make sure to add the following line in the `<head>` section of each HTML file:

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
